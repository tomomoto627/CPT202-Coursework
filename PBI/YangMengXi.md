备注：
前端参数交给王佳琪已经更新过了

后端改了部分字段

UserRepository里：
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, String> {
Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);
}    
另，修改yml文档
url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/booking_system?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC

补充（支付流程）

### PBI：支付优先的二维码流程

- **User Story**  
  As a customer, I want to complete payment before booking creation, so that unpaid requests are blocked and the flow is consistent.

- **Acceptance Criteria**
  - GIVEN I am a customer and have selected a valid slot, WHEN I click submit, THEN the system should create payment intent first and open a payment QR modal.
  - GIVEN payment order is created successfully, WHEN QR modal is displayed, THEN the modal should show amount and a scannable QR code.
  - GIVEN I have finished payment, WHEN I click `Paid`, THEN frontend should call payment confirm API and then call `POST /bookings` to create booking.
  - GIVEN confirm + create booking succeeds, WHEN success modal closes, THEN page should navigate to `My Bookings`.
  - GIVEN Alipay config is missing/invalid, WHEN customer triggers payment creation, THEN frontend should show explicit error and not fake success.


七、支付相关（Booking 扩展功能）
### PBI：支付接口拆分（3个）

#### PBI 1 - 创建支付单接口

- **接口**: `POST /bookings/{id}/payment`
- **User Story**:  
  As a customer, I want the system to create an Alipay order before booking creation, so that I can pay by scanning a QR code first.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - GIVEN slot is valid and available, WHEN calling create payment API, THEN system returns paymentId/paymentToken/qrCodeUrl/amount/currency.
  - GIVEN Alipay key config is missing, WHEN calling API, THEN system returns a clear error and no fake QR is generated.

#### PBI 2 - 支付确认接口

- **接口**: `POST /bookings/{id}/payment/confirm`
- **User Story**:  
  As a customer, I want to confirm payment result from backend verification, so that the frontend can reliably show payment success.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - GIVEN payment exists and belongs to current customer, WHEN clicking `Paid`, THEN backend queries Alipay trade status.
  - GIVEN Alipay status is `TRADE_SUCCESS` or `TRADE_FINISHED`, WHEN confirm API returns, THEN response contains `paymentStatus=SUCCESS`.
  - GIVEN payment is not completed, WHEN confirm API is called, THEN system returns an explicit non-success message.

#### PBI 3 - 支付宝回调接口

- **接口**: `POST /bookings/alipay/notify`
- **User Story**:  
  As a system, I want to process Alipay async notifications, so that payment status can be updated even without manual frontend confirmation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - GIVEN callback is received, WHEN signature verification passes and trade status is success, THEN backend marks draft payment as paid.
  - GIVEN signature verification fails or trade status is not success, WHEN callback is processed, THEN backend returns failure and does not mark paid.

 - 前端

- 预约提交流程改造：`createBooking` 后不再直接跳转，改为弹出支付二维码弹窗。
- 支付弹窗交互完成：展示 `paymentIntentId`、slot、金额、二维码；支持 `Pay Later`、`Cancel`、`Mock Payment` 与 `Paid` 操作。
- 支付确认流程接入：`Paid` 点击后先调用支付确认接口，再调用 `POST /bookings` 创建预约，成功提示后跳转 `My Bookings`。
- 新增模拟支付按钮：主二维码弹窗与悬浮球继续支付弹窗均支持 `Mock Payment`，用于测试环境快速完成支付闭环。

 - 接口/后端

- 新增客户支付接口：
  - `POST /bookings/{id}/payment`（创建支付单）
  - `POST /bookings/{id}/payment/confirm`（确认支付）
- 新增支付宝异步回调接口：
  - `POST /bookings/alipay/notify`
- 支付网关服务接入（Alipay SDK）：
  - 预下单 `alipay.trade.precreate`
  - 订单查询 `alipay.trade.query`
  - 回调签名校验 `rsaCheckV1`
- 支付相关 DTO 完成：
  - `CreateBookingPaymentRequest`
  - `ConfirmBookingPaymentRequest`
  - `CreateBookingPaymentResult`
  - `ConfirmBookingPaymentResult`
- 配置项补充：
  - `alipay.gateway-url`
  - `alipay.app-id`
  - `alipay.private-key`
  - `alipay.public-key`
  - `alipay.notify-url`
### 备注

### PBI 8 - 模拟支付成功接口（测试）
